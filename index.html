            <p class="text-left">Type # 1. Lecture Halls:
                There is a wide variation in the size of lecture halls. With respect to acoustic properties, larger lecture halls may be treated very’ much like theatres, posing the same acoustic design problems as listed in Table 3. If the acoustic design of a lecture hall is good, sound amplification systems may not be required until its size exceeds about 1,400 m3, or the hall accommodates an audience of more than 500.
                n all cases, the reverberation time is probably best calculated on the basis of a 2/3 audience attendance (i.e., for average conditions which assume that the lecture hall will be two thirds full).

                In the design of modern lecture halls, particular attention is paid to achieve the exclusion of external noise, and this implies the exclusion of natural light and ventilation. This can place a premium on the design of ceiling units carrying the necessary artificial lighting, and on achieving suitable suppression of noise in ventilation and air-conditioning systems.

                Smaller lecture halls forming part of a budding (e.g., classrooms in schools and colleges) may demand special attention to exclude external noises generated in adjacent rooms, with particular consideration given to flanking transmissions of noise.

                The acoustic treatment of halls intended for the delivery of both speech and music does not generally present any special problems until the volume of such dual purpose hall exceeds about 3,000 m3.

                The reverberation time can be a compromise between the requirements for speech and music (e.g., a reverberation time between 1 and 2 seconds) and still give acceptable listening, with either speech or music, in the case of smaller halls.

                If the dual-purpose hall is used mainly for speech, the lower reverberation time (nearer to 1 second) would be best. If musical performance, on the other hand, is the main use to which a hall a put, a reverberation time approaching or even slightly exceeding 2 seconds (depending on the type of music to be performed) is desirable.

                One should keep in mind, however, that a compromise reverberation time is not likely to produce entirely satisfactory results with either speech or music.

                    School canteens, commonly referred to as cafeterias in the United States, provide a range of food options from complete, nutritionally-balanced meals to a' la carte choices. Faced with an overwhelming array of choices, and with little nutrition knowledge to guide them, middle and high-school students often struggle making wise lunch choices.
                    School administrators need to have a definite canteen policy, must establish canteen committees to seek to improve service and food quality and must work closely with canteen operators.
